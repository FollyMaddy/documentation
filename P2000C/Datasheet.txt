INTRODUCTION
With the introduction of the P2000C Portable Computer it is now possible to
have a complete computer system in one easily movable package; including the
keyboard, a monitor and two floppy disk drives.
With the possibility to operate in either 8 or l6 bit modes the P2000C combines
the latest in computer design techniques. Flexibility in hardware and software
configuration and the availability of extensive system reference documentation
have produced a fully open architecture.
The P2000C is intended for business professionals of large and small companies,
for small businesses, science and industry and for the dedicated home computer
enthusiast.
The main operating system is CP/M* version 2.2 supplied with specially designed
Philips utilities for disk handling (format, copy) hard disk backup and system
configuration.
An alternative operating system, p-System**, supporting the UCSD PASCAL and
FORTRAN-77 programming languages, is also available.
For 16 bit operation the MS-DOS# version 2.ll operating system is used with the
8088 CO-POWER Board.
This is supplied with a range of MS-DOS oriented utilities.
A configuration program, part of the system software, allows users to design
their own disk, keyboard, video and printer tables and to integrate any combin-
ation of these tables into specific configurations. From the complete internal
character set, a set that suits the user's particular needs can easily be
configured at any time.

Documentation
For technical information on the CP/M Operating System the:
CP/M Reference Manual (order number - 5103 993 ll92l) is available.
Even more information on the hardware itself can be obtained from the:
System Reference and Service Manual (P2599).
This manual includes more on the BIOS, peripherals, circuit diagrams and des-
criptions and the spare part catalogue. It also describes the maintenance
program and contains the Maintenance Disk.
The PZOOOC is delivered complete with the CP/M User's Guide, which explains the
essentials of using CP/M, and the Hardware Operator Manual.
An MS-DOS User's Guide will also be available.

System Architecture
The P2000C consists of the following main units:
- power supply unit and distribution board
- mainboard
- terminalboard
- 9" monitor
- one or two 5%" flexible disk drives (160 KB or 640 KB)
- keyboard ‘
With the exception of the keyboard, all units are contained within the main
casing.
The system architecture is shown in figure 1.


Figure 1. P2000C - System Architecture

-7-

Mainboard
The P2000C Mainboard, which can be used with an external terminal in lieu of
the built in terminalboard, is built around the Z80A processor. It operates at
4MHz when working with RAM and is switched to 2 MHz when working with
additional ROM.
For enhanced data transfer rates, an Intel 8257 Direct Memory Access controller
is used.
Initial program loading is carried out from the IPL ROM, mounted on the
mainboard, which in turn reads the operating system from the designated 'A'
drive. In the event of the system being unable to read in the operating system,
a built in DEBUGGER is available which allows short checks to be performed on
memory, ports, floppy disk, hard disk, video, keyboard and printer.
The random access memory consists of a 64 KB array of HM 4864-2 memories.
Memory management is used to control switching between internal ROM and ex-
ternal RAM and for switching over between internal RAM and the IPL ROM. For
external RAM access, the memory management is handled by external hardware.
In addition to the interface to the terminalboard, the mainboard also handles
the interfaces to a printer, a communications device, external floppy drives
(two additional drives may be connected) and the SASI interface to a maximum of
7 devices (8 bit parallel bus).
Two 4 channel Z80A CTCs, (Z8430A), are used as baudrate generators and as in-
terrupt controllers for the system timer and non-Z8O devices.
The PZOOOC has three fully duplexed serial channels.
Terminal and communication interfaces are controlled by a Z80A SIO (Z8440).
The printer interface is controlled by an Intel 825lA USART.
A free slot is available which allows the addition of either the 8088 CO-POWER
board, the IEC/IEEE bus interface or the memory extension board.
An important use of the memory extension and the 8088 CO-POWER board in the
CP/M environment is as RAM floppy, giving fast access to a mass storage medium.

-8-

Terminalboard
The P2000C Terminalboard, ·which can be used as an external terminal, is built
around the second Z80A processor.
It carries out the following functions:
- control of the monochrome monitor
- scanning of the keyboard
- control of the beeper
Terminalboard memory consists of 32 KB of RAM (in two banks of 16 KB) and 8 KB
ROM.
RAM Bank0 is used as video refresh memory, and is 2, 4 or 8 KB (selectable).
The remaining RAM is used by the CPU (buffer, downloaded IPL, stack etc.).
RAM Bankl is used either as attribute memory or as graphic memory.
P2000C image representation may be:
- alphanumeric with 5 attributes
- medium resolution graphics (4 grey shades) with alphanumeric
representation
- high resolution graphics with alphanumeric representation
Attributes (normal alphanumeric representation only) are:
- underlined
- blinking
- inverted
- bright 0
- bright 1 .. bright 0 and bright 1 are decoded
to give 4 brightness levels
Screen size may be:
- 24 lines by 80 characters (CP/M) or
- 25 lines by 80 characters (MS-DOS)
Note: 25 line MS-DOS requires version 1.3 or later of the terminal ROM.
The character generator ROM contains dot information for 256 characters,
including all ASCII characters and mosaic graphics.
If RAM Bankl is used as graphic memory, there are two possible methods:
- HIGH resolution graphics with 512 x 252 dots
- MEDIUM resolution graphics with 256 x 252 dots
The V24/Internal interface (the interface with the Mainboard) is controlled by
a USART 8251A. The internal link is at TTL level; the V24 connnection (when the
Terminalboard is used as a stand-alone terminal) is buffered by open collector
drivers.

-9-

The CRT Controller is an MC 6845, which generates all the signals required for
controlling a monitor. The video refresh addresses given by the CRTC are only
used to control the alphanumeric characters and attributes.
The lightpen circuit of the CRTC is used in the P2000C for interrogating the
keyboard scan logic, reducing the number of connections between the keyboard
and the terminalboard to six.
The Terminalboard also includes a ZSOA CTC, (Z843OA), used for USART CLOCK,
transmit and receive functions and keyboard handling.

Keyboard
The keyboard has been specially designed for the PZOOOC, with particular
attention having been paid to the ergonomic requirements of the professional
user. It is a low profile unit with sculptured keys on the typewriter section
and has separate function and numeric pads. An LED is incorporated in the
'shift lock' key to indicate that the keyboard is in the shift lock mode.
The keyboard is separate from the main unit and connected by a coiled cable. It
contains only the keyswitch matrix and a few TTL packages.
For transportation the keyboard fits inside the facia of the main unit and is
secured by the carrying strap. The keyboard connecting cable is stowed, with
the mains cable, in a compartment at the back of the unit.
Although the keyboard is obtainable in various language versions, the
electronics of each is identical and only the key-tops differ. The adaption of
the basic keyboard to meet national requirements is carried out by the use of
the Keyboard and Video tables. This is detailed in the CP/M Configuration
Program (part of the System Software).
Figure 2 shows a typical (United Kingdom) keyboard layout.

Figure 2 PZOOOC Keyboard - United Kingdom Version

Monitor
The PZOOOC incorporates a 9" monochrome (green) monitor, with an antiglare
screen. The monitor produces a distortion free display from edge to edge that
is 'easy on the eyes'. The brightness is adjustable from the front panel to
suit the display to ambient lighting conditions.
An external l2" monitor can be connected.

Disk Drives
The Flexible Disk Drives fitted to the PZOOOC are 5 1/4" slim line drives.
The two versions that will be available are:
- 16OK Single Sided, single track density (48 tpi)
- 64OK Double Sided, double track density (96 tpi)
Two additional (external) drives can be connected.

-12-

IEC/IEEE Bus Interface P2091
The P2091 IEC/IEEE bus interface represents a version of the Standard Digital
Interface for Programmable Instrumentation according to the IEEE Std 488-1975,
and deals with the interconnection of programmable electronic measuring devices
under control of the PZOOOC.
The main properties of the P2000C IEC/IEEE bus interface are as follows:
  Completely complies with IEEE 488 and IEC 625 standards.
  Connection of up to 15 devices (in addition to the P2000C).
  A maximum overall distance between PZOOOC and the furthest device of 20m.
  Byte serial, bit parallel, data transfer.
  Multiplexing of addresses, commands and data.
  8 data bus lines.
  8 control bus lines - (3 for bus transfer, 5 for bus management).
  Standard codes for addresses and commands (ASCII or ISO 7 bit code).
  Transparent data transfer.
  Asynchronous communication (handshake).
The IEC/IEEE bus interface allows the P2000C to be incorporated into a system
in the following roles:
- system controller
- controller
- non-controlling device
- analyser/bus controller
Important features of the IEC/IEEE bus interface are:
- able to pass/receive control
- supports serial polling
- supports interrupts on IFC, EOI and SRQ
- supports secondary addressing
- incorporates programmable terminator handling
Physical aspects include:
- individually programmable bus lines
- hardware interrupt

-13-

IECBASIC
The IEC/IEEE bus interface is supplied with an extended IEC/IEEE MBASIC. This
makes it easy for the industrial or scientific user to write the programs he
needs without having to master Assembly programming or the technical details of
IEC/IEEE hardware.
The features of IEC/IEEE extended BASIC are:
- The IEC/IEEE bus statements are fully integrated
  into the Standard Microsoft BASIC Interpreter, so
  low level language need not be used at all.
- Easy-to-program macro statements are used.
- The P2000C IEC/IEEE software distinguishes between
  system controller, controller and non-controller.
- IEC/IEEE addressing is both primary and secondary.
- Polling and service request facilities work with
  P2OOOC as controller or device.
- Specific instrumentation functions are available
  like CLEAR, TRIGGER, LOCAL LOCKOUT, LOCAL, REMOTE -
  all either general or addressed.
- Transfer control.
- Variable input/output formats
  (block/record separators).
- BASIC interrupt subroutines
  (on IFC, SRQ, EOI GOSUB).

-14-

Memory Extension P2092 (for P201O and P2O12)
The P2092 Memory Extension option provides the user with an additional 256 KB
of RAM, which may be'used as RAM Floppy (or cache-memory).
The board occupies the extension socket on the mainboard.
In the Cache Mode, the user has 15 additional banks of memory available, each
covering 16 KB. Each bank can be individually addressed.
The Cache Memory can be visualised in the following way:
  For each of the 15 memory banks, the lower addresses (from OOOOH to 3FFFH)
  are common, allowing data to be effectively 'carried over' to different
  programs. This area is used as the directory area when the RAM Floppy is
  implemented.

  For each of the 15 memory banks, the upper addresses (from COOOH to FFFFH)
  are part of the main memory, allowing data to be 'carried over' to and
  from main memory routines.

  For each of the 15 memory banks, the addresses from 8000H to BFFFH do not
  exist and any attempted access to these addresses while in the Cache Mode
  will give undefined results.

  For each of the 15 memory blocks the 16 KB between 4000H and 7FFFH are
  available to the user. These areas are used to store files when the RAM
  Floppy is implemented.

-15-

16 Bit CO-POWER Board P2093
Conversion to a mixed 8 and 16 bit computer is possible with the incorporation
of the 8088 CO-POWER Board and the associated software. The enhanced machine is
capable of running the MS-DOS operating system on an 8088 processor simul-
taneously with the CP/M-8O operating system on the original Z80 processor.
Machine resources are shared and CP/M use is restricted (see 8088 CO-POWER
description).
The 8088 CO-POWER Board contains memory that can be accessed as main memory by
the MS-DOS operating system or as RAM disk by the CP/M (in the same way as the
Memory Extension Board P2092)·
The MS-DOS implementation has been made as compatible as possible with the IBM
PC-DOS 2, although it has not been possible to make video access compatible for
programs that bypass the operating system and make direct use of the video
memory in the IBM PC.
The 8088 CO-POWER Board is fitted to the extension slot of the P2000C mainboard.
It contains an 8088 processor and has facilities for adding an optional 8087
maths processor.
RAM memory is dependent on the number and type of RAM chips fitted. Using 64 KB
or 256 KB chips, the total available RAM may be:
  - 128 KB (2 banks of 64 KB chips)
  - 256 KB or 512 KB (1 or 2 banks of 256 KB chips)

TESTING
A test program is supplied with the 8088 CO-POWER Board (TEST88) which is used
to exercise the memory and 8088 CPU to confirm that the board is operating
correctly. This program is run from the CP/M environment.
LOADING MS-DOS
The 8088 CO-POWER Board is run under the MS-DOS version 2.11 Operating System.
This is loaded via the CP/M program MSBOOT. This program performs some hardware
tests and determines the amount of available memory before continuing with
loading the operating system. If the 8088 CO-POWER Board is missing or defect-
ive control is returned to the CP/M system.
DISK SUPPORT
The MS-DOS can access two internal 96 tpi double sided floppy drives and an
attached hard disk. Access to internal 48 tpi single sided floppy drives or any
external drives will not be possible. This precludes the use of the 8088 with
the P2010.

-16-

COMMUNICATIONS SUPPORT
Although it is not possible for an MS-DOS application program to access the
communication ports directly through 8088 IO, communication applications can be
executed via Z80 routines or via the 8088 BIOS through software interrupts.
CP/M SOFTWARE UTILITIES FOR USE WITH THE 8088

TEST88 A program to test the functions of the 8088 C0-POWER Board
MSBOOT A program to load an application into the CP/M TPA if required
  and then to boot the MS-DOS operating system into the 8088 and
  transfer control to the MS-DOS.
MSUTIL Functions required when using MS-DOS:
- format floppy to MS-DOS format.
- copy floppy diskettes
- backup of MS-DOS hard disk area
- configuration of hard disk sharing between CP/M and MS-DOS.
